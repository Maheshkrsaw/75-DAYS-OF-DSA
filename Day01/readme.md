# 📘 Day 01 — Problem Solving & Basics in C++

---

## 🧠 How to Solve Any Problem?
- Understand the problem clearly.
- Identify inputs & expected outputs.
- Break into smaller logical steps.
- Write pseudocode or draw a flowchart.
- Translate into C++ code.
- Test with sample inputs.

## 🔄 Flowchart
A **flowchart** is a diagram showing the algorithm’s steps using symbols.

📝 Example (Find min of two numbers):
```
[Start] 
   ↓
Input a, b 
   ↓
Is a < b?
  ↓      ↓
Yes      No
↓          ↓
a is min   b is min
   ↓
 [End]
```

## 📝 Pseudocode
Pseudocode is writing logic in plain English before coding.

📝 Example (Sum of numbers from 0 to n):
```
START
Input n
sum ← 0
FOR i ← 0 TO n
    sum ← sum + i
END FOR
Output sum
END
```

## ⚙️ Understand How Code Runs
- C++ code → Compiled → Machine code → Runs on CPU.
- Steps:
  1. Write code in `.cpp` file.
  2. Compile:  
     ```
     g++ filename.cpp -o output
     ```
  3. Run:  
     ```
     ./output
     ```

## 👨‍💻 Sample Code: Hello World
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
